Scripts for helping on the KOHA Instalation

To install KOHA on a clean linux Server just run the following commands:

1 -$ git clone https://github.com/Okinboxme/systemoeltd_koha

2 -$ cd systemoeltd_koha

3 -$ sh install_koha.sh 

The script at the end will give u the external IP, the user and password to the first KOHA config.

Good Luck
